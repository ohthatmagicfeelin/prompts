I want to refactor the frontend to use the Container/Presentational Pattern:

Here's a breakdown of each layer and its responsibilities:
Presentational/Display Components

Only contain JSX markup and styling
Receive data exclusively through props
Don't know where their data comes from
Don't modify data, only display it
Like a template with holes for data to be filled in
Examples: Cards, Buttons, Forms, Lists, Tables

Container Components

Thin layer that connects hooks to display components
Decides which components to show based on simple conditions
Handles layout and composition of multiple components
Passes data from hooks to display components
Examples: UserProfilePage, DashboardLayout, ProductListContainer

Custom Hooks

Houses all React-specific logic
Manages state and its updates
Handles side effects (useEffect)
Contains event handlers and form logic
Makes API calls and manages loading/error states
Examples: useUserProfile, useProductSearch, useFormValidation

Services/Utils

Pure JavaScript functions
No React dependencies
Handles complex calculations
Validates data
Transforms data between formats
Examples: formatCurrency, validateEmail, calculateTotalPrice


I want to do small chunks at a time, so I can test everything is working before moving onto the next refactor. Make sure to guide on which files to delete afterwards, and what imports (etc) need to change to make the new code work.


we have done the feedback component, move on to the next thign
